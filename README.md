# ATP-Rankings - work-in-progress üë∑üîßÔ∏è‚õè

The sample was created to show different approaches using dependency injection in Android projects 
with [Dagger](https://dagger.dev/) & [Hilt](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection/hilt-android).

## Dependency Injection 

This sample contains multiple branches to show different popular approaches used to provide dependencies in android apps.

### Hilt

Hilt provides a standard way to use DI in your application by providing containers for every Android class in your project and managing their lifecycles automatically.

You can see my [Hilt](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection/hilt-android) implementation on this example:

### Dagger

These are some common implementations used in the Android community
