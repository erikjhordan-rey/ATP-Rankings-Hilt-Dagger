# Rankings ATP Tour Tennis - Hilt
![](./art/atp-tour.png)

The sample was created to show different approaches using dependency injection in Android projects 
with [Dagger](https://dagger.dev/) & [Hilt](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection/hilt-android).

## Dependency Injection 

This sample contains multiple branches to show different popular approaches used to provide dependencies in android apps.

## Hilt

Hilt provides a standard way to use DI in your application by providing containers for every Android class in your project and managing their lifecycles automatically.

You can see my [Hilt](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection/hilt-android) implementation on this example:

## Dagger

There are a few ways you can create a ViewModel instance. Since itâ€™s a lifecycle-aware component, it needs a reference of the lifecycle owner such as an activity or fragment, so the samples contain some practices commonly used on the Android community.

* [dagger-viewmodel-factory - example](https://github.com/erikjhordan-rey/ATP-Rankings-di/tree/dagger-viewmodel-factory) - Basic implementation using [ViewModelProvider.Factory](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/kotlin-android-training-view-model/#0) to instantiate [ViewModels](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel).
* [dagger-viewmodel-module - example](https://github.com/erikjhordan-rey/ATP-Rankings-di/tree/dagger-viewmodel-module) - Classic implementation to provide dependencies using [constructor injection and modules](https://dagger.dev/dev-guide/).
* [dagger-viewmodel-binds-instance - example](https://github.com/erikjhordan-rey/ATP-Rankings-di/tree/dagger-viewmodel-binds-instance) - Avoid arguments in [Dagger - Modules](https://dagger.dev/hilt/modules.html) using [BindsInstance](https://dagger.dev/api/2.10/dagger/BindsInstance.html).
* [dagger-viewmodel-multibindings - example](https://github.com/erikjhordan-rey/ATP-Rankings-di/tree/dagger-viewmodel-multibindings) - Provides a [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) using [Multibindings](https://dagger.dev/dev-guide/multibindings.html).
