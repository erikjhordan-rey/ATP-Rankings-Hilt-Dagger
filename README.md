# ATP-Rankings - work-in-progress üë∑üîßÔ∏è‚õè

The sample was created to show different approaches using dependency injection in Android projects

## Dependency Injection 

### Hilt

Hilt provides a standard way to use DI in your application by providing containers for every Android class in your project and managing their lifecycles automatically.
